It contains a title, a subtitle, a description, a quote, and an image.

## Getting Started

To get started you'll need to  create a [discord application](https://discord.com/developers/applications), make it a bot and get the token for the bot. You'll also need a [firebase account with a firestore db](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/).
